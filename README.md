# Non-Moving Algorithm User Guide

This project contains a non-moving algorithm developed using the React Flow library. This algorithm is created using custom node and custom edge components.

## Project Description

This project includes an example algorithm implemented using the React Flow library. The algorithm represents a process through nodes and the connections between them. However, nodes and connections remain stationary and do not move; they maintain a fixed layout.

## Features

- Custom node components have been created.
- Custom node components have been created.
- Nodes and connections cannot be edited, dragged, or repositioned.
- The algorithm reflects a layout representing a specific process or associated data flow.

## Installation

1. In the project directory, run the following commands to install dependencies: npm install

2. To start the project, use the following command: npm start

This command will launch the project on a local server and display it in your browser.

## Usage

1. After launching the project in your browser, you will see a layout containing non-moving nodes and connections.

2. By clicking on nodes or examining the connections, you can understand the process represented by the algorithm.
